 Weather App LiveRun is a simple and interactive web application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the app fetches data from an external weather API and displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather descriptions.  The application features a search functionality, allowing users to enter a city name and instantly retrieve weather details. It is designed with a responsive user interface, ensuring smooth performance on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.  Through this project, developers can learn how to integrate APIs, handle JSON data, manipulate the DOM dynamically, and implement error handling. The app is an excellent introduction to asynchronous JavaScript and API-based web development.  For those interested in contributing, the project is hosted on GitHub, with detailed instructions for setup, adding API keys, and contributing to improvements. The app is also deployed on Vercel, making it easily accessible online. ðŸš€
